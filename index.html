            <p>Greetings! I am deeply grateful for your visit to my webpage, and even more so for your willingness to support my journey to medical school with a letter of recommendation. Your guidance and insight were invaluable to me in the past and will continue to be invaluable during this pivotal moment.</p>
            <p>In my email, I highlighted a specific theme for your particular letter, aiming to ensure that all letters submitted on my behalf collectively underscore diverse yet complementary facets of my character and abilities. This strategy is intended to present a holistic picture of my suitability for the medical field.</p>
            <p>That said, the approach to writing a letter of recommendation for medical school is different. The AAMC (aka the people who write the MCAT) guidelines offer helpful pointers on crafting your letter to highlight key characteristics essential for a future medical professional: <a href="https://www.aamc.org/system/files?file=2019-09/lettersguidelinesbrochure.pdf" target="_blank" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">Guidelines for Writing a Letter of Evaluation for a Medical School Applicant</a></p>
            <p>Moreover, the letter must be on <span style="color: #FF4081;">official letterhead</span> with a <span style="color: #FF4081;">signature</span> at the end.</p>
            <p>This website is designed to share comprehensive details pertinent to my primary AMCAS application, with a focus on the activities section and personal statement—elements I believe will assist you in composing a letter that truly reflects my potential. While it omits some information like demographics and a full history of my college classes, please be rest assured that the JackWestin admissions team is meticulously reviewing these aspects to ensure accuracy in my final AMCAS and AACOMAS applications.</p>
            <p>Your insights on the personal statement and activities section would be incredibly valuable to me. I am open to any suggestions you might have — whether it's additions, deletions, modifications, or corrections. It is my sincere hope that the information provided here will assist you in composing a letter that not only endorses my application, but also mirrors <span style="font-style: italic;">your belief in my potential to excel as a future physician</span>.</p>
            <p>For a further, comprehensive overview of the primary application process, please have a look at the following guides: <a href="https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/11616/download?attachment" target="_blank" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">2024 AMCAS Application Guide</a> and <a href="https://students-residents.aamc.org/media/13376/download?attachment" target="_blank" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">2024 Work And Activities Guide</a>.</p>
            <p>You should have also received a separate email from Interfolio with a <span style="color: #FF4081;">submission link</span> for the letter, following my initial email. Please let me know if you did not receive it, so I could resend it.</p>
            <p>Interfolio will confirm whether the letter meets the required formatting standards upon submission (official letterhead, titles, and signature). Should there be any issues, you could resubmit.</p>
            <p>Your letter, amongst other letters, will be compiled into a committee letter package by my <a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/advising/pre-med-pre-health/application-timeline" target="_blank">undergrad premed committee</a>, that will then be sent to my prospective schools. While I have not finalized my school list, I am considering both DO and MD programs, with the hope of being accepted into a program that best fits my aspirations.</p>

              <p>I wasn't a particularly ambitious kid growing up. I never had dreams to become a doctor. In fact, I felt discouraged to even pursue the career due to some uninspiring doctor's visits and unpleasant experiences with the members of the care team whenever I went to the hospital or emergency department. I was umambitious to the point that my dream job was to be an idol, and all I ever did back in high school was cross country and maintain my idol tumblr fanpages afterwards. Thus, when I entered college, I did poorly my first year. I didn't bother studying for classes and barely passed. Needless to say, I wasn't remarkable nor stood out in my 300-person lectures, and whenever I went to office hours, I didn't really ask anything about the course content and just bothered the professors and TAs, and it showed. The following school year, I decided to take a semester off. During my semester off, I met a friend who was an iOS developer, and when I watched her remotely decrypt my broken iPhone using the command prompt, I wanted to code like her and proceeded to enroll in my first computer science course at the local community college. The professor for the class encouraged the students to experiment with the code whenever they had a question or wanted to investigate how things worked further. I liked how in computer science, I was able to write a few lines of code and then run it to see the fruits of my labour, compared to a subject like biology where exams determined whether or not effort was put in. When I returned to college, I wanted to engage with computer science even further, so I joined the BINDs lab and worked on a project analysing the Gibbs Free Energy and the severity of different cancer types based on their protein-protein interaction networks. I attended my PI's classes where I learned about quantum computing, chaos computing, and graph theory which all furthered my interest in technology. I still remember in my very first lab meeting of the school year, the PI, Dr Edward Rietman, asked me if I was pre-med, and I answered "no."</p>
              <p>I also became a regular at office hours for my elective humanities courses. I struggled a lot with formulating any clear argument backed up with reasonable evidence for the midterm papers in history and political science courses, since the content seemed to require more background knowledge than the required class readings provided, but at office hours, I'd bounce ideas with my professors and leave with more resources and feel more encouraged. Soon, when papers were not due, I'd still go to office hours and have lengthy discussions about the content covered in class with the professors. Initially, I was ashamed for enjoying my humanities courses more than my STEM courses because all the classmates in my major would complain about having to take such Gen Eds. Little did I know at the time, that a well-rounded physician not only excels at the sciences, but also engages with the arts and literature to further connect with their patients.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to graduating college, where I did a summer internship at Harvey Mudd College to work on multi-compartmental model of T1DM. This project was my first insight into the new and rapidly evolving field of personalised medicine, as the project's goal was to create some fancy mathematical equations on T1DM and finding the best therapy for each patient depending on the severity of their disease. After this internship, I decided to transition out of dry-lab research and confine myself in the clinical microbiology lab of Brigham And Women's Hospital and run samples through a machine or read slides under a microscope to help doctors deduce what is wrong with their patient. Whenever I worked, I always wondered more: what was the patient presenting that warranted the doctor to order all these panels ? How is the doctor treating the patient after I communicated the results of the blood culture to them ? What is the patient's quality of life going to be like after their hospitalisation ? Initially, I asked the senior techs countless questions about the microbes, and they soon put in a good word for me to the clinical pathology residents. Because a pathologist is a not layperson's first thought of a doctor, and has even less prestige than the other non-patient facing dcotor, the radiologist, the pathology residents were enthused for a little disciple who showed interest. The first doctor I ever shadowed was James DiCarlo, MD-PhD, who loved the science behind medicine and not the patient interaction. Still, he encouraged me to further pursue the career and let me shadow a pulmonary pathology signout, attend pathology conferences, and introduced me to other members and parts of a pathology laboratory.</p>
              <p>The pulmonary pathology signout was with Weiwei Shi MD-PhD, Lynette Sholl MD, and Lucian Chirieac MD. I recall Dr. Chirieac giving me a fist bump when he first stepped into the room and letting me ask a million questions after he finished reviewing the all the slides. After that, Dr. Sholl signed out her share of slides, and there was a particular slide suggesting fungus balls in a patient's lung biopsy. She had a her fellow pull up the CXR for the patient, and when she asked me if I knew how to read the films, I told her I didn't. That was when she jumped to her feet and started explaining how to look for abnormalities based on the discolouration and smoke in the film. Her passion for teaching was infectious, and that was when I realised that a physician was not only a healer, but also an educator. I was just a lowly tech who wasn't certified or trained in anything, yet she was enthused and took the time to teach. It reminded me of the time in my senior year of college, despite working for a research lab, I was still weak at reading journals, so I went to Professor Kroeger's office hours and asked her how to read a paper. She didn't put me down and explained each part of the paper and their purpose: the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion, and what I should look for under each of them. I wanted to be like Dr. Sholl and Professor Kroeger and teach and inspire others as anyone I come across could be a colleague in the future.</p>
              <p>Weiwei was a cardiothoracic surgeon back in China, but he came to America to do his PhD. After earning his PhD, he wanted to get back into medicine and figured that pathology would be a good fit. 2 years later, while I was riding my skateboard between parked cars and moving cars around a busy street at MGH, I started feeling knots in my right lower leg every time I pushed on my board. I had experienced this in the past, and it's usually due to overuse from doing tricks, and these knots will soon tighten and put my legs in a spasm. Just when I was about to ride through a crosswalk, the knots started becoming unbearable, suggesting that the long-dreaded spasm will inevitably begin, so I started to hold onto my right leg. A woman in a blue flannel shirt and jeans asked me if I was okay. I paused riding the skateboard and told her "no." My right leg then went into a temporary spasm, and she had me sit and began putting pressure on different parts of it and asking me if it hurt each time. She then told me to stay put, and that she'll be right back. Ten minutes go by, with people simply passing by me, showing that I'm in this large city, I am merely a background character of a film. Soon, the woman emerges out of MGH with a 1L SmartWater and a straw. She told me that she believes I went into a spasm because I was dehydrated due to not drinking enough water throughout the day, the humidity, and I was exercising. She offered to stay with me until I improved, but I told her I was feeling better and will rest for the remainder of the day. I also noticed that she had an "MD" title on her badge, and I asked her what type of doctor she was. She used to be a general practioner back in Iraq, but she was currently doing radiology research to be competitive enough to get a residency in the US. Weiwei and this lovely woman showed me that medicine is a calling, and they went after it even if it meant having to restart from the beginning.</p>
              <p>Soon enough, I transitioned from the running lab tests to helping physicians with their notes down in the emergency department. My curiousity about presentation, differentials, and management were answered working as a scribe. The best part about the emergency department is that cases of all different pathologies are seen, which provides great learning opportunities for wondering young minds. I was fortunate enough to work with physicians who took the time to listen to the patient and go over their the plan of treatment and answer any questions. Countless patients have told the doctors that I worked with they deserve a doctor of the year award. I took the interactions I observed into my role as hospice volunteer, where I listened to the patient talk about their lives and build conversations from what they discuss with me. I also enjoyed speaking with the patient's care team about their progress and the team member's general life because a good physician knows all members of the team works together, and it's good to know them beyond their work as well.</p>
              <p>After observing great physicians and having both professors and physicians let me see my potential and help me receive great opportunities, I want to give back to them through healing others and using my position to build a great team, exchange ideas with others, and mentor future colleagues.</p>

                <li>In my position as a medical scribe, I helped physicians with charting by writing the HPI, recording physical exam findings, noting abnormal labs, outlining the clinical course/plan, and tracking reassessments and other important updates regarding the patient's care. By drafting a rough differential and plan through reading the triage note and prior notes, I picked up on the patterns and algorithms for different chief complaints. Moreover, the job helped reaffirm my interests in medicine as I was with the physician throughout their whole shift and observed how they were able to treat a patient from start to end and was able to ask any questions about the treatment and presentation. (689 characters)</li>
                <li>Most Meaningful Experience: With all the numerous and varied cases that comes through an emergency department each day, the ED is an ideal environment to expose and mold young minds into the world of medicine. Towards the end of a long overnight shift, a patient comes in for a psychiatric evaluation because his mother called the police on him. During the visit, the patient chronicled all the hardships that led him to the ED, from losing his job to being kicked out of a homeless shelter, and he thanked the doctor for listening to it all and letting him rant. Not once did the provider interrupt him or attempt to cut his story short. The interaction showed me that medicine isn't just about treating the disease, but it is about the humanity. Simply providing a listening ear makes a difference, regardless of what the patient comes in with. As a physician, I will let my patients tell their full story and get to know them, as well as ask them and their family members any supplemental questions to further provide better care. Moreover, witnessing other difficult conversations such as encouraging a patient to start detox, or letting the family know the patient is better off on hospice services, has reaffirmed my belief that medicine is equally both about the humanity and the healing, and I hope to be like the providers who I’ve scribed for.

                <li>My role as a Hospice Volunteer involved providing companionship, conversing, and playing games with patients whose family enrolled them into hospice services. My very first patient, Ms P, was only able to respond in “yes/no" phrases, but she loved being asked about her life, family, and pets. It hurt every time I had to leave, as she’d hold my hands tighter whenever I tried to go. When her son sent me a younger photo of her, it brought even more life to the lovely woman. After she passed away, the aides reminisced with me how she was humorous. Chronically ill patients are more than their disease, and as a physician, I want to bring out the best in my patients on their worst days. (692 characters)</li>

                <li>The clinical research coordinator role at MGH Biostatistics is different from the traditional CRC role as there are no patient interactions, but instead focused on handling data queries, data entry, and protocol-related questions from participant-facing coordinators. I was mentored by the data analysts and became comfortable coding in R, including using functions to condense potentially redundant code into just a few lines, using Regex to grab a set of variables, and automating mundane and repetitive tasks. I was able to contribute to the project's code base by writing some data queries for site-level users to correct and helped maintain integrity of the data in the REDCap database.

                <li>Along with the CRC duties, I became the department's unofficial social coordinator after the last one left, and 6 months went by without a social event. After encouragement from coworkers, I decided to arrange a group dinner at a nearby restaurant and posted an announcement on the Slack social channel. There was a good amount of engagement in Slack through the emojis, and on the day of the event, 10 people gathered outside the conference room and headed down the restaurant together. Since this event, I have arranged more group brunches, dinners, and bowling events. When department leadership started noticing my efforts, they asked me to lead the social events section of the monthly newsletter by recapping on the events and providing a flyer for upcoming events. To have more engaging events, I reached out to leadership for a social budget. After writing a proposal, we were granted a budget and organized more events. The experience taught me that if I wanted a team and environment that I had always dreamed of working in, I needed to take the initiative to do it myself. As a physician, I want to use my position to build a close-knit team and get to know the other members of the healthcare team, as they all have important roles and deserve to be recognized, as well as have them get to know each other.

                <li>I decided to work as a clinical lab technologist with the BWH Microbiology lab because I wanted to see what it was like working in a clinical environment. I performed various microbiology testing, such as gram stains, blood cultures, and COVID testing on patient samples sent from the OR, ED, inpatient floors, and outpatient clinics. At times, I had to communicate with other lab departments to troubleshoot issues, and spoke Vietnamese with the technicians to address the matters. Moreover, I trained new employees and helped with documenting new workflows and revised old SOPs. The experience was valuable in showing me how a hospital lab works and the discrepancies between EMRs and lab systems. (699 characters)</li>

                <li>As a volunteer at the Boys And Girls Club, I helped elementary school kids from grades K-8 with their homework in the club's Brain Center. The homework could be for any subject, but primarily English and mathematics, and I tried to engage each child’s learning style to best effectively teach them. Moreover, I helped tracked attendance to the Brain Center, so the program could continue to receive funding. The club was located in an lower socioeconomic area with many bilinguinal and multi-generational households. The most memorable part of this opportunity was connecting with the next generation and hearing them report success in their classes such as becoming the class president. (688 characters)</li>
                <li>Most Meaningful Experience: After helping Sarah finish her vocabulary homework, the Brain Center's manager walks over to our table and asks me to help a 4th grade student wearing a maroon school uniform. I head over to the student's table, and I’m greeted by a sight of a girl with her eyes down and lips frowned, homework in front of her. One section of the homework required finding the flaws with the sentence given, and another section required finding another word for a vocabulary term. I proceeded to show an example by doing the first set of problems and told the student what the sections required. I asked her to do the next problem set, and she missed capitalizing some important words and overlooked mispelled words, but I provided her feedback. Each day for a month, I'd help the student with the homework, and after that month, she began doing the homework on her own and only went to me for corrections. As her school performance improved, I noticed she made new friends at the club and hung out with them after she finished her homework. The experience taught me that despite someone's level, if I provide them help, they will learn and begin to improve, and I hope that I've left a positive impression on the students that I helped tutor. I still remember a lot of the kids that I tutored and occasionally wonder how they are doing. (1321 characters)</li>

                <li>During my summer at Harvey Mudd, I helped further validate a multi-compartmental model of T1DM using MATLAB. Mathematical models for disease processes need to be constantly revised and tested to be accurate and ultimately, practical for clinical use. I also trained the team on how to use Github and maintained the code repository and ensured all team members had the same, updated code at the end of each day. At one point in the project, the team needed to set up a cloud supercomputer to run some computationally intensive code. The research project provided me insights on how mathematical models could be used for disease processes, as well as how newer technologies and medicine could overlap. (699 characters)</li>

                <li>In the BINDs Lab, I was able to apply computer science to biology. My first project involved attempting to retrieve proteins shared between humans and microbes over a long timescale, by analyzing CSVs from various databases. However, the inconsistences between databases cut the project short. My next project involved studying the correlation between cancer severity and Gibbs Free Energy, using KEGG, Cytoscape, and Python. The research experience allowed me to code in a practical setting, as well work independently on a research project, despite it not working out, and then joining another project midway through. I was also fortunate enough to attend classes and seminars hosted by my PI. (695 characters)</li>

After, the instructors and I provided individual feedback. The weekly 2D animation class were implemented after I addressed to the club presidents that low membership of the club in prior years was due to members wanting to learn how to animate and produce their own pieces, not work on a central club project. Club members all had their own works of art they could share with their friends, and some ended up pursing a minor in animation. (698 characters)</li>

At the lowest level of the hospital, was the other side of life where inside the morgue, I was helping the autopsy technicians remove and weigh a deceased patient’s organs and held a human heart for the first time. There may have been a limit to how much medicine could help a patient, but the death does not show that it failed. Instead, it will provide answers for the patient’s family. (655 characters)</li>

                <li>Skateboarding is a great way to go outside, be active, and meet new people. I've met people from all different backgrounds and gained new insights and perspectives talking to them, all thanks to the skateboard uniting us together. When I was a beginner, the skateboarding club guys at UMass kept encouraging me to hang out with them despite them being able to do more complicated tricks, and I learned how to shuv and ride off curbs from them. Like the professors and physicians who didn't look down at me, teaching someone instead of putting them down and discouraging them strengthens relationship and resolute with a hobby, and I hope to take this and inspire others I interact and work with.

                <li>Most Meaningful Essay: Flick the ankle against the back tail, jump up with the board, slide the front foot up towards the nose: those are the steps of an ollie. However, despite its simple description, it takes a long time to learn. After spending 4 hours at the basketball court repeatedly practicing ollies, I put on my jacket and was about to ride off until a man stopped me and insisted that he wanted to give me his deck. He then told me that my ollies would be higher if it was not for the razor-tail on my current deck and proceeds to transfer the parts on my current setup to that deck. For the next 2 years, I would learn how to ollie with the board he had given me, through many repeat attempts and feedback from other skateboarders. Even when I managed to do the ollie consistently, I still couldn't do them over or down anything and still needed to do them switch, fakie, and nollie. In skateboarding, there is always room for improvement. The board is a powerful tool that brings people together to accomplish a common goal with landing that next trick, and it is not able landing the flashiest tricks, but to stick with it, even when there doesn't seem to be any progress. Lastly, the sport led me to maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle, and I plan to continue with it to help me handle the rigors of medical school. (1312 characters)</li>
