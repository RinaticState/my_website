            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I wasn't a particularly ambitious kid growing up. I never had dreams to become a doctor. In fact, I felt discouraged to even pursue the career due to some uninspiring doctor's visits and unpleasant experiences with the members of the care team whenever I went to the hospital or emergency department. I was umambitious to the point that my dream job was to be an idol, and all I ever did back in high school was cross country and maintain my idol tumblr fanpages afterwards. Thus, when I entered college, I did poorly my first year. I didn't bother studying for classes and barely passed. Needless to say, I wasn't remarkable nor stood out in my 300-person lectures, and whenever I went to office hours, I didn't really ask anything about the course content and just bothered the professors and TAs, and it showed. The following school year, I decided to take a semester off. During my semester off, I met a friend who was an iOS developer, and when I watched her remotely decrypt my broken iPhone using the command prompt, I wanted to code like her and proceeded to enroll in my first computer science course at the local community college. The professor for the class encouraged the students to experiment with the code whenever they had a question or wanted to investigate how things worked further. I liked how in computer science, I was able to write a few lines of code and then run it to see the fruits of my labour, compared to a subject like biology where exams determined whether or not effort was put in. When I returned to college, I wanted to engage with computer science even further, so I joined the BINDs lab and worked on a project analysing the Gibbs Free Energy and the severity of different cancer types based on their protein-protein interaction networks. I attended my PI's classes where I learned about quantum computing, chaos computing, and graph theory which all furthered my interest in technology. I still remember in my very first lab meeting of the school year, the PI, Dr Edward Rietman, asked me if I was pre-med, and I answered "no."</p>
            <p>I also became a regular at office hours for my elective humanities courses. I struggled a lot with formulating any clear argument backed up with reasonable evidence for the midterm papers in history and political science courses, since the content seemed to require more background knowledge than the required class readings provided, but at officde hours, I'd bounce ideas with my professors and leave with more resources and feel more encouraged. Soon, when papers were not due, I'd still go to office hours and have lengthy discussions about the content covered in class with the professors. Initially, I was ashamed for enjoying my humanities courses more than my STEM courses because all the classmates in my major would complain about having to take such Gen Eds. Little did I know at the time, that a well-rounded physician not only excels at the sciences, but also engages with the arts and literature to further connect with their patients.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to graduating college, where I did a summer internship at Harvey Mudd College to work on multi-compartmental model of T1DM. This project was my first insight into the new and rapidly evolving field of personalised medicine, as the project's goal was to create some fancy mathematical equations on T1DM and finding the best therapy for each patient depending on the severity of their disease. After this internship, I decided to transition out of dry-lab research and confine myself in the clinical microbiology lab of Brigham And Women's Hospital and run samples through a machine or read slides under a microscope to help doctors deduce what is wrong with their patient. Whenever I worked, I always wondered more: what was the patient presenting that warranted the doctor to order all these panels ? How is the doctor treating the patient after I communicated the results of the blood culture to them ? What is the patient's quality of life going to be like after their hospitalisation ? Initially, I asked the senior techs countless questions about the microbes, and they soon put in a good word for me to the clinical pathology residents. Because a pathologist is a not layperson's first thought of a doctor, and has even less prestige than the other non-patient facing dcotor, the radiologist, the pathology residents were enthused for a little disciple who showed interest. The first doctor I ever shadowed was James DiCarlo, MD-PhD, who loved the science behind medicine and not the patient interaction. Still, he encouraged me to further pursue the career and let me shadow a pulmonary pathology signout, attend pathology conferences, and introduced me to other members and parts of a pathology laboratory.</p>
            <p>The pulmonary pathology signout was with Weiwei Shi MD-PhD, Lynette Sholl MD, and Lucian Chirieac MD. I recall Dr. Chirieac giving me a fist bump when he first stepped into the room and letting me ask a million questions after he finished reviewing the all the slides. After that, Dr. Sholl signed out her share of slides, and there was a particular slide suggesting fungus balls in a patient's lung biopsy. She had a her fellow pull up the CXR for the patient, and when she asked me if I knew how to read the films, I told her I didn't. That was when she jumped to her feet and started explaining how to look for abnormalities based on the discolouration and smoke in the film. Her passion for teaching was infectious, and that was when I realised that a physician was not only a healer, but also an educator. I was just a lowly tech who wasn't certified or trained in anything, yet she was enthused and took the time to teach. It reminded me of the time in my senior year of college, despite working for a research lab, I was still weak at reading journals, so I went to Professor Kroeger's office hours and asked her how to read a paper. She didn't put me down and explained each part of the paper and their purpose: the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion, and what I should look for under each of them. I wanted to be like Dr. Sholl and Professor Kroeger and teach and inspire others as anyone I come across could be a colleague in the future.</p>
            <p>Weiwei was a cardiothoracic surgeon back in China, but he came to America to do his PhD. After earning his PhD, he wanted to get back into medicine and figured that pathology would be a good fit. 2 years later, while I was riding my skateboard between parked cars and moving cars around a busy street at MGH, I started feeling knots in my right lower leg every time I pushed on my board. I had experienced this in the past, and it's usually due to overuse from doing tricks, and these knots will soon tighten and put my legs in a spasm. Just when I was about to ride through a crosswalk, the knots started becoming unbearable, suggesting that the long-dreaded spasm will inevitably begin, so I started to hold onto my right leg. A woman in a blue flannel shirt and jeans asked me if I was okay. I paused riding the skateboard and told her "no." My right leg then went into a temporary spasm, and she had me sit and began putting pressure on different parts of it and asking me if it hurt each time. She then told me to stay put, and that she'll be right back. Ten minutes go by, with people simply passing by me, showing that I'm in this large city, I am merely a background character of a film. Soon, the woman emerges out of MGH with a 1L SmartWater and a straw. She told me that she believes I went into a spasm because I was dehydrated due to not drinking enough water throughout the day, the humidity, and I was exercising. She offered to stay with me until I improved, but I told her I was feeling better and will rest for the remainder of the day. I also noticed that she had an "MD" title on her badge, and I asked her what type of doctor she was. She used to be a general practioner back in Iraq, but she was currently doing radiology research to be competitive enough to get a residency in the US. Weiwei and this lovely woman showed me that medicine is a calling, and they went after it even if it meant having to restart from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Soon enough, I transitioned from the running lab tests to helping physicians with their notes down in the emergency department. My curiousity about presentation, differentials, and management were answered working as a scribe. The best part about the emergency department is that cases of all different pathologies are seen, which provides great learning opportunities for wondering young minds. I was fortunate enough to work with physicians who took the time to listen to the patient and go over their the plan of treatment and answer any questions. Countless patients have told the doctors that I worked with they deserve a doctor of the year award. I took the interactions I observed into my role as hospice volunteer, where I listened to the patient talk about their lives and build conversations from what they discuss with me. I also enjoyed speaking with the patient's care team about their progress and the team member's general life because a good physician knows all members of the team works together, and it's good to know them beyond their work as well.</p>
            <p>After observing great physicians and having both professors and physicians let me see my potential and help me receive great opportunities, I want to give back to them through healing others and using my position to build a great team, exchange ideas with others, and mentor future colleagues.</p>

                <li>In my position as a medical scribe, I helped physicians with their chart in by writing the HPI, recording physical exam findings, noting abnormal labs, outlining the clinical course/plan, and tracking reassessments and other important updates in regards to the patient's care. By drafting a rough differential and plan through reading the triage note and prior notes, I picked up on the patterns and algorithms for different chief complaints. I also had the privilege to observe a physician's day-to-day by being alongside them for their whole shift and witnessed numerous patient interactions. One encounter that sticks with me was how the doctor let the patient rant about all the difficulties in his life, leading up to his current stay in the ED. She did not cut him off at any point, and at the end of the encounter, he expressed gratitude that she listened to him. This taught me that medicine is more than just the symptoms and diagnosis; it is also about the humanity.</li>

                <li>My role as a Hospice Volunteer involved providing companionship, conversing, playing games, and even holding hands with patients whose family enrolled them into hospice and wanted them to have a volunteer to further support them. My most memorable patient was Mrs. R, who was enthused to see me when I first met her. Due to her brain condition, she was not able to speak clearly, but we would play games and draw. I would draw an object, and then she'd take my pen and add her touch to the work. Every time I saw her, she would light up, and it showed me that patients are able to have a friend and something constant in their lives full of rare family visits and short interactions with the care team. The experience also taught me to be patient and forgiving when people forget or repeat themselves or misremember information, as aging is complicated and dreadful, but something we need to be more understanding of.</li>

                <li>While a research assistant for the Margaret Hackett Family Program, I worked with a post-doc, Dr. Seif Gholampour, and another student, on a literature review compiling data regarding different types of CSF parameters and their effects on the mechanisms and treatments of hydrocephalus. I read papers, extracted data and organised them, did some analysis in Excel and SPSS, and wrote part of the results. Moreover, I made corrections to the papers based on reviewer feedback. Having never done a literature review, it was insightful to be involved in the process from the start to end, and being appreciative of the complexities.</li>

                <li>December 2021 - Present</li>
                <li>The clinical research coordinator role at MGH Biostatistics is different from the traditional CRC role as there are no patient interactions, but instead focused on handling data queries, data entry, and protocol-related questions from participant-facing coordinators. I was also fortunate to be mentored by the data analysts and became comfortable coding in R, including using functions to condense potentially redundant code into just a few lines, using Regex to filter for the variables I want to grab, and automating mundane and repetitive tasks. With this new skillset, I was able to contribute to the project's code base by writing some data queries for site-level users to correct and helped maintain integrity of the data in the REDCap database. Moreover, I had duties beyond the research by scheduling and interviewing candidates for the CRC role and organising post-work social events. It was great being involved to further build and strengthen the team/department, and it showed me that sometimes, I needed to taker the initiative to create the team I always envisioned working with.</li>

                <li>I decided to work as a clinical lab technologist with the BWH Microbiology lab because I wanted to see what it was like working in a clinical environment. I performed various microbiology testing, such as gram stains, blood cultures, and COVID testing on patient samples sent from the OR, ED, inpatient floors, and outpatient clinics. I would also help with accessioning specimen and answer phone calls about how to best collect a specimen for certain lab tests. Moreover, I trained new employees and helped with documenting new workflows and revised old SOPs. The experience was valuable in showing me how a hospital lab works and how tests are run, as well as why the site and time of collection is important.</li>

                <li>As a volunteeer at the Boys And Girls Club, I helped elementary school kids with their homework in the club's Brain Center. The area where the club is located is known to be a lower socioeconomic area with many bilinguinal and multi-generational households. The most memorable part of this opportunity was connecting with the next generation and hearing them report success in their classes such as becoming the class president. A particular student I tutored started off weak in her English course and struggled with writing. However, I made sure to provide her with examples of what the teacher was looking for in the homework, and after a month, she started doing her homework on her own and only asked me for minor corrections. As her school performance improved, I saw her make new friends at the club and hang out with them after she finished her homework. I hoped that I was able inspire these kids to continue their education and let them see the opportunities education could open up for them.</li>

                <li>During my summer at Harvey Mudd, I helped further validate a multi-compartmental model of T1DM using MATLAB because mathematical models for disease processes need to go through many testing phases to be considered accurate and ultimately, practical for clinical use. I also trained the team on how to use Github and maintained the code repository and ensured everyone would all have the same, updated code at the end of each day. The research project provided me insights on how algorithms and models could be used for disease processes, and that the future of medicine is held in supercomputers running these complicated code to help the physician provide the best and personalised care for the patient.</li>

                <li>At the BINDs Lab, I was able to apply computer science to biology. My first project involved attempting to retrieve proteins shared between humans and microbrobes over a long timescale, where I downloaded CSVs from various databases and ran analysis through Python. However, the project did not work out due to the inconsistencies of bioinformatics databases. My next project involved studying the correlation between cancer severity and Gibbs Free Energy. I downloaded protein-protein interaction networks for the oxidative phoshorylation and glycolysis pathways for 10 different cancer types and transformed the data using Python, so that Cytoscape is able to graph all the interactions. Since this was my first research experience, I improved my coding skills and was able to use it in a practical setting beyond the confines of a class project, as well seeing a research project not working out and then joining another project midway through. I was also fortunate enough to attend a lot of classes held by my PI and seminars that he set up and learned more about computational biology.</li>

I originally started out as a club member back in Spring 2016 then became an officer when the club underwent restructuring as the leadership graduated. I realised that in the previous years, membership in the club was low because people wanted to learn how to animate and work on their own projects, not work on a central club project, and addressed this issue to the club presidents. They agreed with my resolve, and we started offering weekly courses on 3D animation and 2D computer animation. I helped lead the 2D animation events, where we would teach animation principles and how to use Adobe Animate, and then had the club members students the concepts to onto their blank canvas in Adobe Animate. After, the other instructors and I went around the room and provided some feedback. At the end of it all, the club members all had their own works of art that they were proud of and could share with their friends, and some ended up pursing a minor in animation.</li>

My most memorable experience was shadowing Dr. Jamie Maguire and watching him connect with patients about going to museums or the local foods. A patient told me that I was working with one of the greatest. Despite an unpredictable number of patients assigned to him each day, he still takes his time with each patient he sees, and this transferred to when I volunteered at a hospice and staying longer with a patient when we had great conversation or they needed more companionship, despite my patient list.</li>

                <li>At the HampHack Hackathon, I worked in a group that made a combat video game which required using a home EEG device that would scale in difficulty depending on the brainwaves it received through the device. I helped make character designs and animations for the game, while other group members coded up the game and built the website. Because the game had potential to help its users learn to relax and recognise when their emotions are shifting to lower the difficulty of the game, the panelists saw a great application of the device and awarded us the Brain And Development Prize at the Hackathon.</li>

              <ul class="list-inline">
                <li>Experience Type: Hobbies</li>
                <li>Skateboarding is a great way to go outside, be active, and meet new people. I've met people from all different backgrounds and gained new insights and perspectives talking to them, all thanks to the skateboard uniting us together. When I was a beginner, the skateboarding club guys at UMass kept encouraging me to hang out with them despite them being able to do much more complicated tricks, and I learned how to ollie and ride off curbs from them. Like the professors and physicians who didn't look down at me, teaching someone instead of putting them down and discouraging them strengthens relationship and resolute with a hobby, and I hope to take this and inspire others I interact and work with.</li>
                <li>I also taught myself how to hand-sew and use a sewing machine from Youtube videos. Being able to alter and modify clothes has given new life to older pieces in my closest and allowed me to wear more pieces I would have been discouraged to wear because they did not fit correctly off the rack.</li>
